# ResumeTailor Architecture

![Component Diagram](./static/component%20digram.png)

The **ResumeTailor** application consists of a **Next.js web client**, a **Flask web server**, **Supabase services**, and the **GitHub service**. The **web client** serves as the user interface, allowing users to login, view their github projects and more. It communicates with the **web server** via `https/json` API calls for backend operations like GitHub integration. The **web server** interacts with the **GitHub service** using `https/REST` to fetch user repositories and project data. For authentication, the web server uses the **Supabase Auth service** via the `supabase-py` library, while database operations are handled through **PostgreSQL** using `sqlalchemy`. Supabase internally includes the **Auth service** and the **PostgreSQL database** to manage user sessions and authentication data.

The **Signup** feature begins with the **Browser Client** sending a `POST` request to the Flask server's `/signup` endpoint, containing the user's email and password. The **Flask Server** processes the request and uses the `supabase-py` library to call the **Supabase Auth Service**, which creates a new user by inserting their details into the `auth.users` table in the **PostgreSQL Database**. Once the user is successfully created, the **PostgreSQL Database** sends a confirmation to **Supabase Auth**, which then returns the created user object to the **Flask Server**. Finally, the **Flask Server** responds to the **Browser Client** with a success message, completing the signup process.
